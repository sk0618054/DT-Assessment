## Task Descriptions

  - The starting file is `index.html`.

### Task 2

  - `index.js` handles the dynamic behavior and interactions of the web page.
  - `jsonData.js` contains the JSON data used to populate the HTML content dynamically.

## Getting Started

### Task 1
1. Navigate to the `Task1` folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the static web page.

### Task 2
1. Navigate to the `Task2` folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the dynamic web page.
3. Ensure that `index.js` and `jsonData.js` are correctly linked in `index.html` for the dynamic functionality to work.

## Notes
- Ensure your browser allows JavaScript to run, especially for Task 2.
- For Task 2, make sure that `index.js` properly fetches and processes data from `jsonData.js`.
